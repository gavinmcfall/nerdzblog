## Prequal

Back in March, myself, my friend/colleague Charles and our respective families went down to [Warbirds over Wanaka](https://www.warbirdsoverwanaka.com/) in the beautiful [Queenstown-Lakes District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown-Lakes_District) to see the Airshow.

We both owned cars that we enjoyed driving, but with a tendency towads a lead foot, not cheap to run üòÖ
Since we each needed to rent a car, we took the opportunity to hire an EV, we'd heard so much about them but never actually driven one.
We both hired a BYD Atto 3 and were looking forward to the experience.

One week out from our holiday and we both got an email from the rental comapny, they would be unable to supply use with our cars as both had been badly damaged in accidents...
However, they offered us both FREE upgrades to a Tesla Model 3! Hell yea!

We were in Wanaka for 1 week, and spent a significant amount of time driving around in the Model 3, make many trips backwards and forwards across the [Remarkables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remarkables) between Wanaka and Queenstown.

Needless to say, we were both very impressed with the Model 3, despite being a rental (_rental cars are heavily mistreated and are typically not in great condition_)

Here are a few of the things that really stood out to me:

- Low center of gravity - Having the batteries as a long wide block across the center 2/3 of the car keeps the weight very low. This drastically improves handling
- Balanced distribution of weight - Not having a heavy engine in the front meant that the car was feely evenly balanced front to back (Front: 856kg Rear: 904kg)
- Quiet - I noticed little to no road noise when driving (_except where the road surface was really bad_). This made it easy to have conversations with people in the car without raising our voice\
- Storage - Despire the boot being smaller than the car we currently own (2021 Skoda Superb Sportline Wagon) with the added space in the Frunk (bonnet) for storage, the capacity was similar
- Infotainment - This was a real pleasure to use, the UX (user expereince) si fantastic, well thought out, easy to use, AND regularly updated
- Performance - Even though we were driving the base mode, the instantanous torque was impressive to say the least, especially when pulling out of corners on the open highway.

For me, this experince filled a switch in my head. My "research" switch. Which kicked off a period of Approx 9 months of deep research into the Tesla's and if they would be a good fit as a replacement car for me and my family.

## Gripes with my current car

![Skoda Superb Sportline Wagon](/skoda.jpg)

- Fuel is getting increasingly expensive with 95 Octane costing NZD $2.75 /L with a 70L tank. I'm spending Nearly $200 per fill and filling twice a month
- The car is huge, and parking it is a pain
- The Infotainment SUCKS!
  - ITs really slow to start
  - Apple CarPlay lags like crazy
  - The Radio still doesnt show the names of radio statios, because the importer wont allow it for privacy reasons...
  - Its had the steeringwheel replaced multiple times because radar guided cruise control stops working
  - I was without an engine cover for a year whilst skoda redesigned it to prevent fires in the enginebay

Don't get me wrong, its a good car. But a lot about it is frustrating.
It was time for a change

## Tesla concerns

Everyone watches videos online and hears all the negative things about Tesla. Its easy to have a strong BIAS against them without actually having had any exerpeince with one.
But holding onto that BIAS is the place of fools. I wanted to find out the real story and I did my reseach.

First, I wanted to make sure that Tesla was the right choice from a pure specifications perspective.
I spent a lot of time in google sheets, pulling in specification data and comparing all the cars in the market.
Looking and weight, length, width, boot space, price, power/torque, warrency, range etc. It was an exhaustive list

This affirmed that Price : Spec, nothing beat out the Tesla.

So the next question, build quality.
Now I am a Quality Assurance Engineer by trade, having done Software, Hardware and Firmware testing. I know that nothing is every perfect. However, I'd heard some nasty stories about build quality and I wanted to do some digging.

First, I want to cut Tesla some slack, they are are "new" company in the car manufacturing game, and people are unfairly comapring the build quality with companies that are 100+ years old.
Those early 5+ years will be shaky for any brand as they refine their processes.
That said, I did hear a lot about panels not lining up and that was my greatest concern.

After a lot fo digging, this is what I found out.

- The majority of the issue existed only for customers in the US, taking delivery of cars built in the Freemon/California factory.
- Very few issues with the cars out of Beijing, China (_Which is where New Zealand get its Tesla's from_)
- 99% of these issues were not present on the 2023+ models and I'd heard of no issues on the Hardware 4 "Highland" Model 3's
- There are exhaustive checksheets you can get for delivery day to make sure everything is good and you don't drive away if there are issues
- You have 72 hours post delivery to bring up any issues that would cause a delivery rejection, beyond that you fall back to issues being resolved uner warrenty
- NZ has a STRONG Consumer Guarantees Act that protects the consumer from issues

## Fast forward to 2024-Dec-03

It's my Birthday ü•≥, My Wife and I had been away over the weekend for a supprise trip to Waitomo to see the glow worm caves and today we had planned to go into [Tesla Auckland South](https://www.tesla.com/en_ZA/findus/location/service/TeslaCentreAucklandSouth) to see the Model 3 Perfomance (_Highland_) and take it for a Test drive

We want to see how it performed, what it looked like in the flesh and if we like the changes.

Let me tell you, The INSANE accelleration profile lives up to the name. I have never felt my internal orgs press against my spine until that moment, its wa amazing‚ÄºÔ∏è üòç
Back to the dealership and chatting with the Sales guy I learned some useful information

- Tesla had just increased it referral discount to $1,600 for me, and $800 in Tesla credit for the referrer
- Tesla also used [UDC Finance](https://www.udc.co.nz/index.html)
- Tesla were offering 2.99% my existing car was at 7.98%

Tesla using UDC made this choice even easier as my Skoda was financed with UDC. Here is how it works

1. You purchase the car through Tesla and pay the (_100% refundable if finance or Trade-in fails_) deposit of $400
1. Choose UDC for the Finance
1. You tell Tesla that you are trading in a car
1. You let them know that money is oweing on the car and that its with UDC
1. Tesla will give you a trade-in valuation on your car
1. If you accept, Tesla will subtract the amount oweing on your existing loan, pay it off to UDC on your behalf, and give you the balance of the trade-in as a reduction in the total loan amount.

Example (arbitrary numbers for easy math):

- The new car is worth $100,000
- Your trade-in is valued at $50,000
- You still owe $25,000 on the trade-on
- Total new finance = NewCarPrice - (Trade-in value - OldCarBalance)
- Total new finance = $100,000 - ($50,000 - $25,000) = $75,000

The next day, I contacted a colleague at work and asked for their Referral code to order a new Tesla.

### The Car

- Tesla Model 3 Performance Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive
- Ultra Red Paint
- 20" Warp Wheels
- Black Premium Interior
- Autopilot
- Enhanced Auto Pilot
- ~~Full Self-Driving Capability~~

I decided FSD (Full Self-Driving Capability) was not worth the cost

Delivery should been between Jan-Feb 2025 (March if I am unlucky)
