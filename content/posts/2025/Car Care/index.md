## Protecting Your Investment

### Insurance

So you just spent all this money are a new car, and if your smart, you will want to protect that investment.
There are a few things you can do.

First of all, you should have insurance before you even drove the car away.
There are many insurance companies out there and dealing with this is a Royal PITA.
In my experince, it is much better to deal with a broker, they act on your behalf and communicate with all the different insurance companies to find the best deal that suits your needs. They do no charge you, as the insurance companies pay them to bring in new clients, and the deals they offer you are always better than if you went direct to the Insurance company.

We use [Hutchison Rodway Insurance](https://hutchisonrodway.co.nz/)
They have been awesome and handle our House, Contents and Vehicle Insurance.
We always deal with Jo Mitchel, feel free to [call](tel:094772835) or [email](jo@hutchrod.co.nz) her

⚠️ NOTE: If your vehicle has a glass roof, ENSURE that you Insurance company counts it as a windshield so you get one free replacement per year if it gets cracked/damaged

### Long Term Protection

Once you have the car, you may choose to protect the paint and body work in a manner designed to keep it looking good for years to come.
There are several different things you can take a look at:

#### Vehicle Wrap

- **Purpose:** Changes the car's appearance (color, patterns, or designs) and offers light protection.
- **Material:** Vinyl film.
- **Protection Level:** Minor protection against scratches, chips, and UV rays.
- **Customization:** High—can include matte, gloss, satin, carbon fiber, or custom designs.
- **Durability:** 3–7 years, depending on quality and care.
- **Cost:** Moderate to high, based on coverage and design complexity.
- **Best For:** People looking to customize their car’s look or advertise a brand while adding light protection.

#### Paint Protection Film (PPF)

- **Purpose:** Provides strong protection against scratches, chips, and abrasions.
- **Material:** Transparent polyurethane or polymer film.
- **Protection Level:** High—absorbs impacts and can self-heal minor scratches.
- **Customization:** Clear, but some brands offer matte or colored variants.
- **Durability:** 5–10 years with proper care.
- **Cost:** High—especially for full-body applications.
- **Best For:** People prioritizing protection for high-end, exotic, or new cars to maintain factory paint quality.

#### Ceramic Coating

- **Purpose:** Provides a long-lasting, hydrophobic (water-repellent) layer for shine and easier cleaning.
- **Material:** Liquid polymer that chemically bonds to the paint.
- **Protection Level:** Protects against UV rays, dirt, and chemical stains, but not scratches or chips.
- **Customization:** None—focuses only on enhancing the car's natural paint and gloss.
- **Durability:** 2–5 years, depending on maintenance.
- **Cost:** Moderate. Higher initial cost but lower maintenance than wax or sealants.
- **Best For:** People who want a glossy finish, easy maintenance, and protection against dirt and weather.

#### Tinted Windows

- **Purpose: Improves privacy, reduces glare, blocks UV rays, and keeps the car cooler.
- **Key Features:
    - **Privacy** – Makes it harder for others to see inside the car.
    - **UV Protection** – Blocks up to 99% of harmful UV rays, reducing skin damage and fading of interiors.
    - **Heat Reduction** – Helps keep the interior cooler by reflecting solar heat.
    - **Glare Reduction** – Reduces glare from sunlight and headlights, improving visibility and comfort.
    - **Safety** – Helps hold shattered glass together in case of an accident.
    - **Style** – Enhances the appearance of the vehicle.
- **Types:**
    - **Dyed Film** – Budget-friendly, reduces glare, and adds privacy but offers less heat reduction.
    - **Metalized Film** – Reflects heat well and strengthens windows but may interfere with GPS and radio signals.
    - **Carbon Film** – Provides excellent UV protection and heat rejection without signal interference.
    - **Ceramic Film** – Premium option with the best heat reduction, UV protection, and clarity, and no signal interference.

#### Costs (approx NZD)

- Full Car Ceramic = $800
- Full car PPF = $5000 - $10,000 (Soo many variables)
- Vehicle Wrap = $5000+
- Tinbts = $400 - $1000

#### Options

I decided to go with a mixture of the following

- PF M8 Satin/Matte PPF - Full external vehicle
- HV2 Ceramic Coating - Full external vehicle over PPF
- PTL50 Ceramic Tints @ 47% (Sides and rear window)
- Interior fabric hydrophobic treatment
    - Applied to seats, door cards & dash (all ‘leather’ trims)
- Chrome delete front & rear (T ,TESLA & DualMotor)
